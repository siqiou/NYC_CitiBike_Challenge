## Summary: 
This analysis showed opportunity for the bike-sharing program. We can suggest targeting male subscribers as they have the most number of rides. The best location would be Mangattan, and the best time would be either 7am in the morning or 5-7 pm in the afternoon to provide services. People tend to ride more on weekdays rather than weekends, probably because they use the bike sharing as a way of commute. Overall, we do see lots opportunities in the program.

In the future, we would suggest gathering 1) Pricing and renewing data from subscribers, to test the price sensitivity which can help us set the subscription fee to attract more people while maintaining profitable. 2) A dashboard visualizing starting and ending locations for each gender, we can differentiate the purpose of bike riding and customize different plans for users.
